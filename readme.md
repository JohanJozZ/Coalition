Front End Developer Dynamic Skills Test V2
for Coalition technologies.

Used HTML CSS and Vanilla Javscript only to make a responsive website with data retrieved from the Coalition Technologies Patient Data API. 

You can click on patients on the left and update information on the site dynamically.  

Icons were previously compiled into a fontello css file, to make the html more readable. 

Used Chart.js to create the graph, made it resposive and used flex-wrap around it to make that section look fine on smaller devices. Dropdown menu works and will adjust the graph x axis. All the data is gathered from the coalitions API.
